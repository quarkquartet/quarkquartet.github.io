Things familiar to us, such as gas-liquid transition, solid-liquid transition, are all first-order phase transitions. The character is the existence of the specific boundary between these phases. On the contrary, if no such a boundary exists between phases, we call it second-order phase transition. Example could be difficult to find in daily life for second-order phase transition. The most popular example may be the ferromagnetic phase transition that we learned in our undergrad.\nPhase transitions also happen in the early universe. For example, we know that particles acquire there masses from their interactions with Higgs. But at the very early time of the universe, these masses do not exist. Higgs, as well as other particles, is massless. When the universe gradually cools down, masses are generated below a certain critical temperature. This process is also a phase transition, known as the electroweak phase transition (EWPT).\n图片来自arXiv:hep-ph/0609145 There is no clear evidence for now whether EWPT is first-order or not. While the Standard Model (SM) predicts a second-order PT, beyond SM physics may modify it to be first-order. Even though EWPT finally turns out to be second-order, there is highly a chance in the early universe that a similar phase transition existing much earlier than EWPT that can be first-order.\nIf the EWPT is first-order, scenario in the above picture can happen. Particle masses shift from 0 to a finite number, and there is a boundary between these two. The region inside the boundary is known as the bubble.\nThis bubble really behaves like a physical wall. It can collide with particles surrounding it, and it can collide with another bubble wall. And indeed, as the phase transition proceed, the bubble walls expand and really collide with each other.\nJust as the collision between two balls in the real world can create sound wave, the bubble collisions can create gravitational waves (GW).\nThere has been answers about how the GWs are created. In one word, it comes from the breaking of the spherical symmetry of the stress-energy tensor in the universe. If the universe is made of homogenous things, the stress-energy tensor is apparently homogenous and spherical symmetry is kept. However, various perturbations can break this symmetry. Einstein’s equation tells us that GW can be produced once the stress-energy tensor is no longer spherically symmetric.\nIf we talk about these things in the context of bubbles, there are three known-types of GW sources.\nThe first one is the bubble collision itself.\nThe bubble is nothing but a shell of masses. It carries energy. If the bubble is not re-shaping, not colliding, but just expanding, the stress-energy tensor is still spherically symmetric, and no GW is produce.\nHowever, when the bubbles collide with each other, the shape of shell changes. e.g. In the above figure, bubble merges, and the shells disappear in the region where bubbles overlap. This is not spherically symmetric, and GW can be produced.\nSee: Gravitational waves from bubble collisions: analytic derivation\nThe second one is the sound wave after the bubble collision.\nThe early universe is not a vacuum, but rather filled by plasma. The plasma is the most perfect fluid. Sound wave can of course be produced by these bubbles.\nAgain, if the bubbles are just expanding, the sound waves are spherically symmetric, and no GW can be produced. The key is that the spherical symmetry in the sound wave is also broken by the bubble collision. GW are thus source by this sound wave.\nSee：Sound shell model for acoustic gravitational wave production at a first-order phase transition in the early Universe\nThe third part is MHD turbulence. I know very rare things about it, and I’ll not review it here.\nThese three sources has been known as all the sources of GW during bubble collision in the past decades. However, the paper introduced today provides a new possible source: bubble collision can produce particles, whose energy distribution is also non-spherically-symmetric, and thus GW can be sourced.\nThere has been known papers talking about particle production by bubbles. Fast-moving bubbles are similar to colliders. Heavy particles can be created. The more energy the bubble shell carries, the heavier particle it can create. This particle production mechanism could be found in a paper earlier last year.

I’m not assuming the readers are expert, so I may write some things that look explicit/naive to some senior people.\nThe papers may not be very new and up-to-date.\nToday I’ll introduce 2 papers from the UMD theory group in the past 2 years.\nDetecting Axion-Like Particles with Primordial Black Holes\nLight in the Shadows: Primordial Black Holes Making Dark Matter Shine\nCan current-existing primordial black holes (PBH) help us detecting new particles? These 2 papers show a great example.\nThe first paper is very straightforward: PBH can emit particles, and thus can become a natural source of particle factory. As long as those produced particles can be detected, it’s promising for new physics discovery or exclusion.\nThis paper uses axion-like particle (ALP) as an example. Here we assume that the ALP decays into a pair of photons. If ALP is produced from PBH and decays into photon pair before arriving to the earth, it’s promising to be detected by future experiments like e-ASTROGRAM or AMEGO.\nCan the Standard Model (SM) produce similar signal? Yes. The PBH can directly radiate out photons. However, ALP can distort the photon spectrum, and still lead to new physics discovery, shown in the following plot.\nIt’s easy to see that ALP can change the shape of the detected photon spectrum. After performing statistical analysis to quantify how large the deviation is between the ALP-modified spectrum and the pure SM result, we can probe ALP from the photon spectrum distortion.\nResults shown in the next plot.\nThe shaded region is the projected reach: assuming the black hole has the corresponding mass (e.g. red color means PBH haves a mass of $10^{15}$ g.), ALP with such a mass and coupling is projected to be discovered. If we have such a PBH but still not discoverd, then this parameter space is excluded.\nOr we can do it oppositely: if we want to probe a specific parameter space, what is the required PBH mass?\nThe answer is given in the next plot: e.g. the blue curve means only PBH with parameters located in the upper region is capable of producing enough 1 MeV ALPs to be discovered.\nUsing the similar way, if we go one step more, PBH can do the following for us:\nSometimes dark matter annihilation nowadays is weak, and it’s very difficult to find dark matter from indirect detection (which captures the annihilation product of dark matter). For example, asymmetric dark matter has a low current abundance of the anti-particle of the dark matter. The dark matter cannot find is annihilation partner, and thus indirect detection is difficult.\nPBH can make it up: lack of annihilation partner? I’ll produce for you.\nThat’s what the second paper is doing.\nThis paper has 2 example models. Here I would just mention one of them: the boosted anti-dark matter (BaDM). The result plot is the following:\nSome key points:\nHow is the detectable particle mass range determined? The answer is PBH temperature, which behaves like $1/M_{\\rm PBH}$. A lighter PBH leads to a higher temperature, making it easier to radiate new particles. That’s why the parameter to the upper-’left’ region of the curve in the above plot is capable. Too light PBH evaporate too early and cannot survive until today, so there should be a lower limit on the PBH mass. That means we cannot detect particles with arbitrarily high mass. What’s the advantage of PBH versus accelerators? The PBH produces particles with gravitational effects rather than particle couplings. So BSM particles can be strongly produced even if the coupling is weak. Producing a weakly-coupled particles, on the contrary, is difficult in accelerators. And, I love the introduction of the second paper!\n","date":1734912000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1734912000,"objectID":"88a45b1e98404e1113bdbe8747a2de36","permalink":"https://quarkquartet.github.io/en/post/PBH_newphysics_paperintro/","publishdate":"2024-12-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/PBH_newphysics_paperintro/","section":"post","summary":"Paper introduce: Primordial black holes can play a role as a factory to produce new BSM particles","tags":["primordial black hole","dark matter","axion-like particle","physics","probe","cosmology","astrophysics","asymmetric dark matter","indirect detection"],"title":"Primordial black hole as a source of new physics detection","type":"post"},{"authors":["Gordan Krnjaic","Duncan Rocha","Isaac R.

Experts may find it trivial.\nTable of Contents A Description for the Strong CP problem Parity solution Axion solution A Description for the Strong CP problem It has been a long time since we found that the Standard Model (SM) is a chiral theory, i.e. left and right-handed particles have different properties. Though it could be a natural, or simple, feeling, to claim that a beautiful model should be left-right symmetric, it does not seem cautious to impose this symmetry when we consider beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics until we find some really solid reason. Fortunately, there is a problem, known as the strong CP problem, that can be solved eligantly under the left-right symmetry, or known in a more professional phrase, parity symmetry.\nSo, what is strong CP problem, and how parity symmetry can solve it?\nPerhaps you have heard about the neutron electric dipole moment (EDM). What can the dipole moment be?\nA naive calculation from classical physics is straightforward: the neutron contains one up-quark and two down-quarks. One can easily build a coordiante system and label the angle $\\theta$ in a way shown in the following picture. Apparently the dipole moment is $$ \\frac{d_n}{e} \\simeq 10^{-13} \\sqrt{1-\\cos \\theta}~\\mathrm{cm} $$ A classical description for the neutron EDM and the strong CP phase. Taken from Anson Hook’s lecture note. If there is no force to make the angle $\\theta$ some fixed value, we would expect this angle is randomly distributed, and thus the neutron EDM. However, current experiment has shown this number to be always close to zero: we never observe any single neutron with an EDM larger than $10^{-26}e~\\rm cm$!\nThis immediately implies the vanishing of the $\\theta$ term. But why?\nThe vanishing of this $\\theta$ is called the strong CP problem. Strictly speaking, strong CP problem is not a solid problem. You can just accept it and claim it as a coincidence. But, perhaps it’s a long-standing pursue of particle physics community, it’s just difficult for us to accept such a unnaturally small parameter in a model.\nIf you can’t accept it and must turn to solid problems like dark matter, emmmmmm, there is no objection. And as far as I know, the number of people who believe “strong CP problem is a problem” is as much as those who does not believe so. Just take it easy and think about it in a way you want.\nYou may wonder are there any quantum-level description of the above stuff. Yes. In SM, we can chirally rotate the quark fields like $\\psi \\rightarrow \\psi e^{i \\gamma_5 \\theta_s}$, and the Lagrangian acquires an extra term (if you are not familiar with this, you can refer to Chapter 29 and 30 of Matthew Schwartz’s textbook for quantum field theory) $$ \\mathcal{L} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{L} + \\theta_s\\frac{g_s^2}{32\\pi^2} G_{\\mu \\nu} \\tilde{G}^{\\mu \\nu}, $$ where the $G$ field is the gluon field. Actually, since the fermion fields are not observable and can be written in any basis, the above term is generally existing and must be included in the Lagrangian. Rotating the quark field can shift the angle $\\theta_s$ into $\\arg (Y_u Y_d)$, where $Y_{u,d}$ is the Yukawa matrix. The difference, on the other hand, $\\bar{\\theta} \\equiv \\theta_s -\\arg (Y_u Y_d) $, will not be changed and thus is physical!\nComputation shows that this angle is indeed proportional to the neutron EDM $$ \\frac{d_n}{e} \\simeq 5 \\times 10^{-16} \\bar{\\theta}~\\mathrm{cm}. $$ So the smallness of this $\\bar{\\theta}$ is the strong CP problem.\nParity solution We can immediately think about it in this way: there must be some rules that forces the quarks to be aligned along a straight line! One possibility is that the neutron must be left-right symmetric, or parity-symmetric. And thus strong CP problem is solved. The parity symmetry at the quantum level can be described as $$ SU(2)_L \\leftrightarrow SU(2)_R, Q \\leftrightarrow \\bar{Q}, L \\leftrightarrow \\bar{L}, H_L \\leftrightarrow H_R. $$ Here we use the two-component Weyl notation for fermions. $Q$ and $L$ are quarks and leptons, respectively. Right-handed fermions are doublets under $SU(2)_R$. You can easily prove that this makes $\\bar{\\theta}$ vanishes at tree level.\nThis solution is called the parity solution to the strong CP problem.\nAxion solution Another way to think about this problem is: maybe there is an “axis” where the quarks are forced to be aligned along?\nEmmmm yeah that’s possible. At quantum level, we say there is a new particle whose vacuum expectation value (vev) makes the neutron EDM to be 0. This particle is called QCD axion. The Lagrangian is $$ \\mathcal{L} = \\frac{a}{f_a} \\frac{g_s}{32\\pi^2} G_{\\mu \\nu} \\tilde{G}^{\\mu \\nu} + \\frac{1}{2} \\partial_\\mu a \\partial^\\mu a $$ The axion vev is acquired when $\\langle a \\rangle /f_a = - \\theta_s$. This cancels the anomaly term and thus the strong CP problem is solved. For the details of the potential of $\\theta_s$ term and axion, see Anson Hook’s lecture note.\nThe Lagrangian …","date":1691884800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691884800,"objectID":"d7afa5664eb2ed480ae0163fbe812cf5","permalink":"https://quarkquartet.github.io/en/post/strongCP/","publishdate":"2023-08-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/strongCP/","section":"post","summary":"An introduction about strong CP problem and its solutions.

However, if no new physics is appearing, the symmetry would be restored at high temperature. The transition from the restored Higgs potential symmetric phase to the broken phase during the universe cooling down is called the electroweak phase transition (EWPT).\nIf new physics appear, depending on the form of new physics, the phase transition may be enhanced, or on the other hand, the symmetry may not be restored at high temperature. Both are strongly motivated for various problems, especially by the baryogenesis problem. Specifically, in 1985, it was presented that electroweak phase transition may provide the necessary condition for baryogenesis if it’s strongly first order. This mechanism is known as electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG). However, the phase transition is known to be a smooth crossover after Higgs mass was measured.\nThis is not the end of the story. People know that a simple scalar extension in the Higgs sector could enhance the phase transition so that a strongly first-order phase transition may appear. On the other hand, if the real model of this world contains a larger gauge group and multiple electroweak-like phase transitions in the early history, this mechanism may still work at some moment.\nAt least, there are a few things below that worth investigating.\nModels including electroweak-like phase transition at high energy scale We have tons of models that include a gauge group symmetry breaking pattern at high energy scale. For example, the parity-symmetric model contains a phase transition $SU(2)_R \\times U(1)_X \\to U(1)_Y$. More interesting phase transition also appears, for example, in GUT theroy, in twin-Higgs theory, and so forth. The phase transition happens for different scalar fields, or have different interactions, or have different coupling strength, compared to the standard model.\nFor example, in parity-symmetric model, the running coupling, especially the running of $\\lambda$, will make the achievement of a strong first-order phase transition much easier.\nIt could be a very interesting direction to investigate the phase transition and phase thermal history of those models.\nComputation of phase transition quantities On the other hand, the electroweak phase transition is very technical. The prediction of baryon asymmetry is pretty controversial. These include (but not limited to):\nWall velocity Baryon number asymmetry Phase transition strength Without a trustable method, we cannot make prediction for models. Given the strong motivation for electroweak (-like) phase transition stated before, it could be very valuable to improve the computation of various quantities in the phase transition.\n","date":1688515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688515200,"objectID":"e51686e30f75b95d964efcd376af09fc","permalink":"https://quarkquartet.github.io/en/project/EWBG/","publishdate":"2023-07-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/EWBG/","section":"project","summary":"Electroweak (-like) phase transition is expected to happen in the early universe, given the well-known spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking.

New chiral fermions charged under the extended gauge symmetry have nonzero lepton numbers, which makes the $B-L$ symmetry anomalous.

A bubble wall dynamics associated with the first-order phase transition and $SU(2)_R$ sphaleron processes generate a lepton asymmetry, which is transferred into a baryon asymmetry via the ordinary electroweak sphaleron process. Unlike the Standard Model electroweak baryogenesis, the new phase transition can be of the strong first order and the new CP violation is not significantly suppressed by Yukawa couplings, so that the observed asymmetry can be produced. The model can be probed by collider searches for new particles and the observation of gravitational waves. One of the new leptons becomes a dark matter candidate.
