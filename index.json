I’m in particular interested in the origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry, as well as other cosmological and experimental probes of interesting physics. This page shows research directions that I’m currently working on. Other interesting topics may also catch my eye in the future.\nParity-symmetric model The smallness of the strong CP phase in the Standard Model has been a puzzle for decades, called “the strong CP problem”. One elegant solution is to impose a parity symmetry $L\\leftrightarrow R$ and extend the SM gauge group as $SU(3)_c \\times SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_X$. This symmetry can forbid the strong-CP phase at least at tree-level, and provide a high-scale, electroweak-like phase transition $SU(2)_R \\times U(1)_X \\rightarrow U(1)_Y$.\nThis extension of the standard model provides possibility to solve other problems together. For example, the new phase transition may open a window to generate the baryon asymmetry in a similar mannor of the well-known electroweak baryogenesis, see this paper for details. It can also provide good dark matter candidiates, if any of the new fermions are neutral and stable.\nBesides the work for baryogenesis mentioned above, I’m currently working on dark matter signatures, and also exploring more possibility to produce interesting signals.\nElectroweak phase transition and electroweak baryogenesis The electroweak phase transition, if strong first order, offers out-of-thermal-equilibrium condition required for successful baryogenesis. However, the Higgs quartic coupling is too strong so that the electroweak phase transition in the SM is a smooth crossover. Extension is required to enhance the phase transition. Furthermore, interesting thermodynamics are involved once we talk about the details of phase transition and CP-violating interactions which is another necessary piece for the baryon asymmetry.\nI work on model buildings to extend the phase transition, and I spend plenty of time exploring interesting thermodynamics.\nProbes light particles in experiments Besides heavy BSM particles, potential light particles are also strongly motivated and waiting to be probed. One famous example is the dark mediator. It’s well known that dark matter is an existing puzzle, and they are part of a “dark sector” in many models. The dark mediator is the only way that dark sector talks with the SM particles, and thus dark mediator is strongly motivated. The parameter space are in wide range, but typically they are not too heavy (far below EW scale). Among them, some light and weakly interacting mediators are particularly interesting for their potential to solve the muon $g-2$ puzzle. Those particles are typically long-lived, and give specific experimental signatures such as displaced vertex.\nI study on possible new searches on this type of long-lived mediators. For example, dark photon and dark scalar.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://quarkquartet.github.io/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"My research","tags":null,"title":"Research","type":"page"}]
